        <h1 id="title">Why I Like Math</h1>
        <h2>My Reason</h2>
        <p>I enjoy math a lot. It's like an enjoyable puzzle for me that I can solve. While I'm not necissarily a math "wizard", I still enjow the idea of being able to solve things using math.</p>
        <h2>My Favorite Subject in Math</h2>
        <p>My favorite subject in math is algebra, because it is what works with equations the most. There are sometimes in math class, where I honestly start to miss algebra, and I often get excited when I see an algebraic problem on the homework every know and then.</p>

                <li>Why was the equal sign so humble? Because it knew it wasn't less than or greater than anyone else.</li>
                <li>Why was the obtuse angle so sad? Because it was never right.</li>
                <li>The last joke is pretty funny, but in order to read it, you have to find it!<br>You can find it by hovering over a specific thing on this page, and it's your job to find out what that thing is.</li>
