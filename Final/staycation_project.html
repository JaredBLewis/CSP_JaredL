                            <h2>The History of Sundance</h2>
                            <p>In the mid-1800s, the Stewart family obtained property on the mountain and the land was passed down through their family. It was mostly a rural area until 1920 when it was connected by one unpaved road. In 1922 there were some hiking trails put in, and according to Wikipedia, "The Stewart family appreciated the hikes since they brought more popularity to the area." Later in 1944 the mountainside became a ski area known as Timp Haven, and over the next few years, the Stewart family created a ski resort. In 1968 Timp Haven was purchased by Robert Redford and was renamed Sundance because of the film Redford played in, known as <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i> (shown in the image to the right). Since then, Sundance has continued to grow, and is the perfect vacation resort for many.</p>
