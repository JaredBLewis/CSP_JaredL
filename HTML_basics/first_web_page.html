        <h1>My Medical History</h1>
        <p>For my entire life, I’ve never been to a hospital, been vaccinated, or used any form of antibiotics. The only major form of medical treatment that could change this is when I get anesthesia for getting my wisdom teeth removed. Now, you may wonder how I’ve never been to a hospital, if I was born in one, but the answer is simple. I was born at home. So, why haven’t I been vaccinated? This is a question that usually comes up with a lot of people that I talk to. And What usually happens is they automatically assume one of two things: My parents are crazy, or I’m crazy. While I try to explain to them the best I can that I am indeed not a hazard to society, and that I feel that I am actually healthier without vaccines, they can’t help but tell me that I am entirely, and absolutely wrong. Some of the people who tell me this really know their stuff and point out every possible reason why I am wrong, while others just tell me I’m wrong. Either way, I have been interested in the thought of vaccines, whether or not they are harmful or not, and have tried my best to find out for sure. The truth has turned out to be pretty hard to find, and I don’t want to have vaccines unless I know they are 100% safe, so before you compare me to some passionate Flat-Earther who absolutely has no idea what they’re talking about, let me explain what I believe about vaccines.
        <h2>My Reasoning</h2>I don’t believe that vaccines are entirely bad, but I don’t believe they are completely safe either. To look back, vaccines were invented by a guy in Europe called Louis Pasteur. As you know, a lot of cities in Europe were not sanitary in the least, and people would usually dump human waste into the streets. Pasteur investigated the world of germs, and took samples of different air qualities in different places. He also investigated the human immune system and a variety of other germs and bacteria. He eventually found that inserting a weak amount of germs into the human body, caused the body to be able to easily defeat it, which then helped the body, because whenever the body ran into that germ again, it would know exactly how to destroy it. This discovery revolutionized modern medicine, and has become known as vaccines. I completely agree with what vaccines are meant to do, what I disagree with, is all of the unnecessary ingredients that the vaccines are chalked full of. Let's relate this to red-40 or MSG, which are harmful ingredients. They can easily be replaced by other less dangerous ingredients, or even just completely removed without changing the result or purpose of the food, which is to give the body nourishment. This is how I feel about vaccines, they aren’t in definition bad, and they do currently serve a good purpose, but the damage that they can cause is higher than it needs to be.</p>
