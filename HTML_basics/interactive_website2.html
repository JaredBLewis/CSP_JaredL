                <p>So far, in this class I have learned a lot of things about, web development, the hardware in computers, and some of the ways of programming. Out of all these things that we have been learning, my overall favorite, was learning how to program. We learned the languages of C++ and Python, and I had a blast. This has inspired me so much, that I'm planning on learning plenty of more programming languages after I leave this class.</p>
