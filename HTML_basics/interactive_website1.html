        <h1>The F4U Corsair</h1>
        <p>The F4U Corsair is one of my favorite planes during WW2. It was a Naval based fighter jet, designed to counter Japan's dreaded Zeros, and did such an amazing job, that it was still used well into the Korean War, where it even faced off with fighter jets! Although most people have the P51 Mustang as their favorite plane of that era, mine will continue to be the F4U corsair.</p>
